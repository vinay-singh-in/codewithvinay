ISC Computer Practical 2008, Question 1
Smith Number

A Smith number is a composite number, the sum of whose digits 
is the sum of the digits of its prime factors obtained as a 
result of prime factorization (excluding 1). 

The first few such numbers are 4, 22, 27, 58, 85, 94, 121, ...

Example :
1. 666
Prime factors are 2, 3, 3 and 37
Sum of the digits are (6 + 6 + 6) = 18
Sum of the digits of the factors (2 + 3 + 3 + (3+7)) = 18

2. 4937775
Prime factors are 3, 5, 5, 65837
Sum of the digits are (4 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5) = 42
Sum of the digits of the factors (3 + 5 + 5 + (6 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 7)) = 42

Write a program to input a number and display whether the number is 
a Smith number or not.

Sample data:

Input:  94
Output: SMITH Number

Input:  102
Output: NOT SMITH Number

Input:  666
Output: SMITH Number

Input:  999
Output: NOT SMITH Number

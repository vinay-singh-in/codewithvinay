ISC 2013 Computer Science Practical, Question 3

A palindrome is a word that may be read the same way in either direction. 
Accept a sentence in UPPER CASE which is terminated by either “.”, “?”, or “!”. 
Each word of the sentence is separated by a single blank space.

Perform the following tasks:
a) display the count of palindromic words in the sentence.
b) Display the palindromic words in the sentence.

Example of palindromic words:

MADAM, ARORA, NOON

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

Example 1
INPUT:  MOM AND DAD ARE COMING AT NOON
OUTPUT: MOM DAD NOON
        NUMBER OF PALINDROMIC WORDS : 3

Example 2
INPUT:  NITIN ARORA USES LIRIL SOAP.
OUTPUT: NITIN ARORA LIRIL  
        NO PALINDROMIC WORDS: 3

Example 3
INPUT:   HOW ARE YOU?
OUTPUT:  NO PALINDROMIC WORDS

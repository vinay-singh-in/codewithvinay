ISC 2013 Computer Science Practical, Question 2

Write a program to declare a square matrix A[][] of order (M X M) where ‘M’ is 
the number of rows and the number of columns such that M must be greater 
than 2 and less than 20. 

Allow the user to input integers into this matrix. 
Display appropriate error message for an invalid input. 

Perform the following tasks:
a) Display the input matrix.
b) Create a mirror image of the inputted matrix.
c) Display the mirror image matrix.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:  M = 3
        4   16   12
        8    2   14
        6    1    3
OUTPUT: ORIGINAL MATRIX
        4   16   12
        8    2   14
        6    1    3

        MIRROR IMAGE MATRIX
        12   16   4
        14    2   8
        3    1   6

Example 2
INPUT    :   M = 22
OUTPUT   :   SIZE OUT OF RANGE

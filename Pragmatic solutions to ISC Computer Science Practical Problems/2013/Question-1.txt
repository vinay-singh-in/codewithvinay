An ISBN ( International Standard Book Number) is a ten digit code which 
uniquely identifies a book. The first nine digits represent the Group, 
Publisher and Title of the book and the last digit is used to check 
whether ISBN is correct or not. Each of the first nine digits of the 
code can take a value between 0 and 9. 

Sometimes it is necessary to make the last digit equal to ten; this is done 
by writing the last digit of the code as X. 

To verify an ISBN, calculate 10 times the first digit, plus 9 times the 
second digit, plus 8 times the third and so on until we add 1 time the 
last digit. 

If the final number leaves no remainder when divided by 11, the code is a valid ISBN.

For example:

02011003311 = 10*0 + 9*2 + 8*0 + 7*1 + 6*1 + 5*0 + 4*3 + 3*3 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 55
Since 55 leaves no remainder when divisible by 11, hence it is a valid ISBN.

Design a program to accept a ten digit code from the user. For an invalid input, 
display an appropriate message. Verify the code for its validity in the format 
specified below:

Test your program with sample data and some random data.

Example 1
INPUT CODE : 0201530821
OUTPUT : SUM = 99
LEAVES NO REMAINDER – VALID ISBN CODE

Example 2
INPUT CODE : 035680324
OUTPUT : INVALID INPUT

Example 1
INPUT CODE : 0231428031
OUTPUT : SUM = 122
LEAVES REMAINDER – INVALID ISBN CODE

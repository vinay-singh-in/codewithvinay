ISC 2009 Computer Science Practical, Question 1
Day After 'N' days

Design a program to accept a day number (between 1 and 366), year (in 4 digits) 
from the user to generate and display the corresponding date. 

Also, accept ‘N’ (1 <= N <= 100) from the user to compute and display the 
future date corresponding to ‘N’ days after the generated date. 

Display an error message if the value of the day number, year and N are not 
within the limit or not according to the condition specified.

Test your program with the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:
DAY NUMBER: 		    233
YEAR: 			        2008
DATE AFTER (N DAYS): 	17

OUTPUT:
DATE: 			        20 TH AUGUST, 2008
DATE AFTER 17 DAYS: 	6 TH SEPTEMBER, 2008

Example 2

INPUT:
DAY NUMBER: 		    360
YEAR: 			        2008
DATE AFTER (N DAYS): 	45

OUTPUT:
DATE: 			        20 TH AUGUST, 2008
DATE AFTER 45 DAYS: 	8 TH FEBRUARY, 2009

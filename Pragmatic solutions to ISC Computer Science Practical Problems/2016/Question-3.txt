ISC 2016, Computer Science Practical, Question 3

Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either '.', '?' 
or '!' only. 
The words may be separated by more than one blank space and are in UPPER CASE. 

Perform the following tasks:
a) Find the number of words beginning an ending with a vowel.
b) Place the words which begin and with a vowel at the beginning, followed 
   by the remaining words as they occur in the sentence.

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

Example 1
INPUT:  ANAMIKA AND SUSAN ARE NEVER GOING TO QUARREL ANYMORE.
OUTPUT: NUMBER OF WORDS BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH A VOWEL = 3
        ANAMIKA ARE ANYMORE AND SUSAN NEVER GOING TO QUARREL

        A ARE YOU MUST AIM TO BE BETTER PERSON TOMMORROW THAN YOU TODAY

Example 3

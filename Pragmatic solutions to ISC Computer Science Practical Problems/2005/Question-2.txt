ISC Computer Practical 2005, Question 2
Test for Wonderous Square

A wondrous square is an n by n grid which fulfills the 
following conditions:
(i)  It contains integers from 1 to n^2, where each integer 
     appears only once.
(ii) The sum of integers in any row or column must add up 
     to 0.5 * n * (n^2 + 1).

For example the following grid is a wondrous square where 
the sum of each row or column is 65 when n = 5:

17  24  1   8   15
23  5   7   14  16
4   6   13  20  22
10  12  19  21  3
11  18  25  2   9

Write a program to read n (2 < n < 10) and the values stored in these
n by n cells and output if the grid represents a wondrous square or not.

Also output all the prime numbers in the grid along with their 
row index and column index as shown in the output. 

A natural number is said to be prime if it has exactly two divisors. 
E.g. 2,3,5,7,11 ………..

The first element of the given grid i.e 17 is stored at row index 0 
and column index 0 and the next element in the row i.e. 24 is stored 
at row index 0 and column index 1.

Test your program for the following data and some random data.

SAMPLE DATA:

INPUT:
N = 4
16  15  1   2
6   4   10  14
9   8   12  5
3   7   11  13
OUTPUT:
YES IT REPRESENTS A WONDROUS SQUARE.
PRIME   ROW INDEX   COLUMN INDEX
2       0           3
3       3           0
5       2           3
7       3           1
11      3           2
13      3           3
15      0           1 <-- 15 is not a prime

 

INPUT:
N = 3
1   2   4

ISC Computer Practical 2005, Question 3
Anagram

We would like to generate all possible anagrams of 
a word. 
For example if the given word is ‘TOP’, there will 
be 6 possible anagrams:

TOP
TPO
OTP
OPT
POT
PTO

An anagram must be printed only once. You may output 
the anagrams in any order. 

Also, output the total number of anagrams. 

You may assume that the number of letters,  N, in the 
word will be 7 at most, i.e. N < 7

Test your program for the given data and some random data.

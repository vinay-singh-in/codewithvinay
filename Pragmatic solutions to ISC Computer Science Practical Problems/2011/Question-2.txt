ISC 2011 Computer Science Practical, Question 2

Encryption is a technique of coding messages to maintain 
their secrecy. A String array of size ‘n’ where ‘n’ is greater 
than 1 and less than 10, stores single sentences 
(each sentence ends with a full stop) in each row of the array.

Write a program to accept the size of the array. 
Display an appropriate message if the size is not satisfying 
the given condition. 

Define a string array of the inputted size and fill it with 
sentences row-wise. 

Change the sentence of the odd rows with an encryption of 
two characters ahead of the original character. 
Also change the sentence of the even rows by storing the sentence 
in reverse order. 

Display the encrypted sentences as per the sample data given below.

Test your program on the sample data and some random data.

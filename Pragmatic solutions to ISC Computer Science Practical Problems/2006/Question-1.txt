ISC Computer Practical 2006, Question 1
Consecutive Integer Sum

A positive natural number, (for e.g. 27), can be represented as follows â€“
2+3+4+5+6+7
8+9+10
13+14
Where every row represents a combination of consecutive natural numbers, which add up to 27.

Write a program which inputs a positive natural number N and prints the possible consecutive number combinations, 
which when added give N.

Test your program for the following data and some random data.
SAMPLE DATA
INPUT:  N = 9
OUTPUT:
    4 + 5
    2 + 3 + 4

INPUT:  N = 15
OUTPUT:
    7 + 8
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    4 + 5 + 6

INPUT:  N = 21
OUTPUT:
    10 + 11
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
    6 + 7 + 8

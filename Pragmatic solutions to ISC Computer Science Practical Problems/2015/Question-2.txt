ISC 2015, Computer Science Practical, Question 2

Write a program to declare a square matrix A[][] of order M x M where ‘M’ is the
number of rows and the number of columns, such that M must be greater than 2 and less
than 10. Accept the value of M as user input. Display an appropriate message for an
invalid input. Allow the user to input integers into the matrix. Perform the following
tasks:
a) Display the original matrix.
b) Rotate the matrix 90o clockwise as shown below:
    Original matrix                 Rotated matrix
    1 2 3                           7 4 1
    4 5 6                           8 5 2
    7 8 9                           9 6 3

c) Find the sum of the elements of the four corners of the matrix. 

Test your program for the following data and some random data:
Example 1:
INPUT:  M = 3
        3   4   9
        2   5   8
        1   6   7
OUTPUT:
ORIGINAL MATRIX
        3   4   9
        2   5   8
        1   6   7
MATRIX AFTER ROTATION
        1   2   3
        6   5   4
        7   8   9
Sum of the corner elments = 20

Example 2:
INPUT:  M = 4
        1   2   4   9
        2   5   8   3
        1   6   7   4
        3   7   6   5
OUTPUT:
ORIGINAL MATRIX
        1   2   4   9
        2   5   8   3
        1   6   7   4
        3   7   6   5
MATRIX AFTER ROTATION
        3   1   2   1
        7   6   5   2
        6   7   8   4
        5   4   3   9
Sum of the corner elments = 18

EXAMPLE 3
INPUT:  M = 14
OUTPUT: SIZE OUT OF RANGE

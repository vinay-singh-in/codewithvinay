ISC 2015, Computer Science Practical, Question 1

Given two positive numbers M and N, such that M is between 100 and 10000 
and N is less than 100. 

Find the smallest integer that is greater than M and whose 
digits add up to N. For example, if M = 100 and N = 11, then the smallest 
integer greater than 100 whose digits add up to 11 is 119.

Write a program to accept the numbers M and N from the user and print the 
smallest required number whose sum of all its digits is equal to N. 

Also, print the total number of digits present in the required number. 

The program should check for the validity of the inputs and display an 
appropriate message for an invalid input.

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT:  M = 100
        N = 11

OUTPUT: The required number = 119
        Total number of digits = 3

Example 2

INPUT:  M = 1500
        N = 25

OUTPUT: The required number = 1699
        Total number of digits = 4

Example 3

INPUT:  M = 99
        N = 11

OUTPUT: INVALID INPUT

Example 4

INPUT:  M = 112
        N = 130

OUTPUT: INVALID INPUT

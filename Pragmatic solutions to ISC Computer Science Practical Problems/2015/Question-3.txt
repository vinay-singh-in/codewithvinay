Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either ‘.’ Or ‘?’ only.

The words are to be separated by a single blank space. Print an error message if the input
does not terminate with ‘.’ Or ‘?’. 

You can assume that no word in the sentence exceeds 15 characters, so that 
you get a proper formatted output. 

Perform the following tasks:
i)  Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase.
ii) Find the number of vowels and consonants in each word and display them
    with proper heading along with the words.
Test your program with the following inputs:

Example 1
INPUT:  Intelligence plus character is education.
OUTPUT: Intelligence Plus Character Is Education
Word           Vowels Consonants
Intelligence    5      7
Plus            1      3
Character       3      6
Is              1      1
Education       5      4


Example 2
INPUT:  God is great.
OUTPUT: God Is Great
Word           Vowels Consonants

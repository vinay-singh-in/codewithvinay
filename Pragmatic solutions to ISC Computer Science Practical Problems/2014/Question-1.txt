ISC 2014, Computer Science, Question 1

A Composite Magic number is a positive integer which is composite as well as a magic number.
Composite number: A composite number is a number that has more than two factors. For example: 10, factors are: 1, 2, 5, 10
Magic number: A magic number is a number in which the eventual sum of the digits is equal to 1. For example: 28=2+8=10=1+0=1

Accept two positive integers m and n, where m is less than n as user input. Display the number of Composite Magic integers that are in the range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them along with the frequency, in the format specified below.
Example 1:

Input:  m=10
        n=100
Output: THE COMPOSITE INTEGERS ARE:
10, 28, 46, 55, 64, 82, 91, 100
FREQUENCY OF COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS IS: 8

Example 2:

Input:  m=1200
        n=1300
Output: THE COMPOSITE INTEGERS ARE:
1207, 1216, 1225, 1234, 1243, 1252, 1261, 1270, 1288
FREQUENCY OF COMPOSITE MAGIC INTEGERS IS: 9

Example 3:

Input:  m = 120
        n=99
Output: INVALID INPUT

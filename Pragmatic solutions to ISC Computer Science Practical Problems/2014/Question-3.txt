ISC 2014 Computer Science Practical, Question 3

Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by 
either ‘.’, ‘?’ or ‘!’ only. Any other character may be ignored. 

The words may be seperated by more than one blank space and are in UPPER CASE.

Perform the following tasks:

a. Accept the sentence and reduce all the extra blank space between 
   two words to a single blank space.
b. Accept a word from the user which is a part of the sentence along
   with its position number and delete the word and display the sentence.

Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1

INPUT: A MORNING WALK IS A IS BLESSING FOR THE    WHOLE  DAY.
WORD TO BE DELETED: IS

ISC 2014, Computer Science Practical, Question 2

Write a program to declare a square matrix A[][] of order MxM where ‘M’ is the number of rows
and the number of columns, such that M must be greater than 2 and less than 10. Accept the value
of M as user input. Display an appropriate message for an invalid input. Allow the user to input
integers into this matrix. Perform the following tasks:
a) Display the original matrix.
b) Check if the given matrix is symmetric or not. A square matrix is said to be symmetric, if
   the element in the i th row and j th column is equal to the element of the j th row and i th
column.
c) Find the sum of the elements of left diagonal and the sum of the elements of right diagonal
   of the matrix and display them.
Test your program for the following data and some random data:

Example 1
INPUT:  M= 3
        1 2 3
        2 4 5
        3 5 6
OUTPUT: ORIGINAL MATRIX
    1 2 3
    2 4 5
    3 5 6
THE GIVEN MATRIX IS SYMMETRIC
The sum of the left diagonal = 11
The sum of the right diagonal = 10

Example 2
INPUT:  M= 4
        7 8 9 2
        4 5 6 3
        8 5 3 1
        7 6 4 2
OUTPUT: ORIGINAL MATRIX
        7 8 9 2
        4 5 6 3
        8 5 3 1
        7 6 4 2
THE GIVEN MATRIX IS NOT SYMMETRIC
The sum of the left diagonal = 17
The sum of the right diagonal = 20

Example 3
INPUT:  M= 12
OUTPUT: THE MATRIX SIZE IS OUT OF RANGE

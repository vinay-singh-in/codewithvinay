Question 2

Write a program to declare a Matrix A[][] of order (M x N) where 'M' is the 
number of rows and 'N' is the number of columns such that the value of 'M' must 
be greater than 0 and less than 10 and the value of 'N' must be greater than 2 and 
less than 6.

Allow the user to input digits (0-7) only at each location, such that each row represents an octal number.

Example:
2 3 1 (decimal equivalent of 1st row = 153 i.e. 2*8^2 + 3X8^1 + 1*8^0)
4 0 5 (decimal equivalent of 1st row = 261 i.e. 4*8^2 + 0X8^1 + 5*8^0)
1 5 6 (decimal equivalent of 1st row = 110 i.e. 1*8^2 + 5X8^1 + 6*8^0)

Perform the following tasks on the matrix:
(a) Display the original matrix
(b) Calculate the decimal equivalent for each row and display as per the format given below.

Example 1
INPUT
M = 1
N = 3
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 1 4 4

OUTPUT
FILLED MATRIX		DECIMAL EQUIVALENT
1 4 4				100

Example 2
INPUT
M = 3
N = 4
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 1 1 3 7
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 2: 2 1 0 6
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 3: 0 2 4 5

OUTPUT
FILLED MATRIX		DECIMAL EQUIVALENT
1 1 3 7			        607
2 1 0 6			        1094
0 2 4 5			        165

Example 3
INPUT
M = 3
N = 3
ENTER ELEMENTS FOR ROW 1: 2 4 8

OUTPUT
INVALID INPUT


Example 4
INPUT
M = 4
N = 6

OUTPUT
OUT OF RANGE

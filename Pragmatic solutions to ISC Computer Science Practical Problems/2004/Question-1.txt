ISC Computer Practical 2004, Question 1
Smallest Base Problem

Numbers have different representations depending on the 
bases on which they are expressed. 
For example in base 3, the number 12 is written as 
110 (1 x 32 + 1 x 31 + 0 x 30), but in base 8 it is 
written as 14(1 x 81 + 4 x 80).

Consider, for example, the integers 12 and 5. Certainly 
these are not equal if base 10 is used for each. 
But suppose 12 was a base 3 number and 5 was a base 6 
number then what happens, 12 base 3 = 1 x 31 + 2 x 30, 
or 5 base 6 or 5 base 10 (5 in any base is equal to 5 
base 10). 
So 12 and 5 can be equal if you select the right bases 
for each of them.

Write a program to input two integers, X and Y, and 
calculate the smallest base for X and smallest base 
for Y (likely different from X) so that X and Y 
represent the same value. 

The base associated with X and Y will be between 1 and 
20 (both inclusive). In representing these numbers the 
digits 0 to 9 have their usual decimal interpretations. 

The upper case alphabetic characters A through J 
represent digits 10 through 19 respectively.

Test your program for the following data and some 
random data:

SAMPLE DATA:

INPUT:
X = 12
Y = 5

OUTPUT:
12(base 3) = 5 (base 6)


INPUT:
X = 10
Y = A
OUTPUT:
10 (base 10) = A (base 11)


INPUT:
X = 12
Y = 34
OUTPUT:
12 (base 17) = 34 (base 5)


INPUT:
X = 123
Y = 456
OUTPUT:
1 2 3 is not equal to 456 in any base between 2 to 20


INPUT:
X = 42
Y = 36
OUTPUT:
42 (base 7) = 36 (base 8)

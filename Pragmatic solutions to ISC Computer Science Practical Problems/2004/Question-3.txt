ISC Computer Practical 2004, Question 3
Machine Usage Problem 

The manager of a company wants to analyse the machine 
usage from the records to find the utilization of the 
machine. He wants to know how long each user used the 
machine. When the user wants to use the machine he must 
login to the machine and after finishing the work he must 
log off the machine.

Each log record consists of:
 User identification number.
 Login time and date.
 Logout time and date.
Time consists of:
 Hours
 Minutes

Date consists of:
 Day
 Month

You may assume all logins and logouts are in the same 
year and there are 100 users at the most. The time 
format is 24 hour machine hours and minutes.

Design a program:
(a) To find the duration for which each user has logged. 
    Output all records along with the duration in 
    hours (format hours: minutes).

(b) Output the record of the user who logged for the 
    longest duration. You may assume that no user will 
    login for more than 48 hours.

Test your program for the following data values and some 
more random data.

SAMPLE DATA:

INPUT:
Number of users: 3
USER            LOGIN           LOGOUT
IDENTIFICATION  TIME & DATE     TIME & DATE
149             20:10 20-12     2:50 21-12
173             12:30 20-12     12:30 21-12
142             16:20 20-12     16:30 20-12


OUTPUT:
USER            LOGIN           LOGOUT          DURATION
IDENTIFICATION  TIME & DATE     TIME & DATE     HOURS:MINS
149             20:10 20-12     2:50 21-12      6:40
173             12:30 20-12     12:30 21-12     24:00
142             16:20 20-12     16:30 20-12     00:10
THE USER WHO LOGGED IN FOR THE LONGEST DURATION
173             12:30 20-12     12:30 21-12     24:00

ISC 2010 Computer Science Practical, Question 1
Denomination Breakup

A bank intends to design a program to display the denomination of an
input amount of upto five digits. The available denomination with the
bank are of rupees 1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1.

Design a program to accept the amount from the user and display the
breakup in descending order of denomination, (i.e. preference shoud be
given to the highest denomination available) along with the total number
of notes. [Note: Only the denominations used should be displayed.]
Also print the amount in words according to the digits.

Example 1
INPUT:  14856
OUTPUT: ONE FOUR EIGHT FIVE SIX
        DENOMINATION 
        1000    x   14          =   14000
        500     x   1           =     500
        100     x   3           =     300
        50      x   1           =      50
        5       x   1           =       5
        1       x   1           =       1
        TOTAL                   =   14586
        TOTAL NUMBER OF NOTES   =      21

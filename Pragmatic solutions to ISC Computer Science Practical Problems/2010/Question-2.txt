ISC 2010 Computer Science Practical, Question 2
Kaprekar number

A positive whole number ‘n’ that has ‘d’ number of digits is 
squared and split into two pieces, a right-hand piece that 
has ‘d’ digits and a left-hand piece that has remaining ‘d’ 
or ‘d-1’ digits. 
If the sum of the two pieces is equal to the number, then ‘n’ 
is a Kaprekar number. 
The first few Kaprekar numbers are: 9, 45, 297, ...

Example 1:
9
9*9  = 81, 
right-hand piece of 81 = 1 and left hand piece of 81 = 8
Sum = 1 + 8 = 9, i.e. equal to the number.

Example 2:
45
45*45 = 2025, 
right-hand piece of 2025 = 25 and left hand piece of 2025 = 20
Sum = 25 + 20 = 45, i.e. equal to the number.

Example 3:
297
297*297 = 88209, 
right-hand piece of 88209 = 209 and left hand piece of 88209 = 88
Sum = 209 + 88 = 297, i.e. equal to the number.

Given the two positive integers p and q, where p < q, write a program 
to determine how many Kaprekar numbers are there in the range 
between p and q (both inclusive) and output them.

The input contains two positive integers p and q. 
Assume p < 5000 and q < 5000. You are to output the number of 
Kaprekar numbers in the specified range along with their values 
in the format specified below:

SAMPLE DATA:

INPUT:
p = 1
q = 1000

OUTPUT:
THE KAPREKAR NUMBERS ARE:-
1, 9, 45, 55, 99, 297, 703, 999
FREQUENCY OF KAPREKAR NUMBERS IS: 8

ISC Computer Practical 2021, Question 1
Fascinating Number In A Range

A fascinating number is one which when multiplied by 2 and 3 and then, 
after the results are concatenated with the original number, the new 
number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. 
There can be any number of zeros and are to be ignored.

Example:     
273 
273 * 1 = 273 
273 * 2 = 546 
273 * 3 = 819 
Concatenating the results, we get 273546819 which contains all digits 
from 1 to 9 exactly once. Thus 273 is a fascinating number.

Accept two positive intgers m and n, where m must be less than n and 
the values of both 'm' and 'n' must be greater than 99 and less than 
10000 as user input.
Display all fascinating numbers that are in the range between m and n 
(both inclusive) and output them along with the frequency, in the 
format given below:

Test your program for the following data and some random data.

Example 1:  
INPUT:  m = 100
        n = 500
OUTPUT: THE FASCINATING NUMBERS ARE:
192 219 273 327
THE FREQUENCY OF FASCINATING NUMBER IS: 4

Example 2:
INPUT:  m = 900
        n = 5000
OUTPUT: THE FASCINATING NUMBERS ARE:
1902 1920 2019 2190 2703 2730 3027 3270
THE FREQUENCY OF FASCINATING NUMBER IS: 8

Example 3:
INPUT:  m = 400
        n = 900
OUTPUT: THE FASCINATING NUMBERS ARE:
NIL
THE FREQUENCY OF FASCINATING NUMBER IS: 0

Example 4:
INPUT:  m = 70
        n = 450
OUTPUT: Invalid range

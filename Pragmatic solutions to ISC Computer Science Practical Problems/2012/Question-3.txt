ISC 2012 Computer Science Practical, Question 3

Write a program to declare a matrix A [ ] [ ] of order (MXN) where ‘M’ is the
number of rows and ‘N’ is the number of columns such that both M and N must be
greater than 2 and less than 20. Allow the user to input integers into this matrix.
Perform the following tasks on the matrix:
(a) Display the input matrix
(b) Find the maximum and minimum value in the matrix and display them along
    with their position.
(c) Sort the elements of the matrix in ascending order using any standard sorting
    technique and rearrange them in the matrix.
(d) Output the rearranged matrix.

Test your program with the sample data and some random data:
Example 1
INPUT:  M = 3
        N = 4
        8   7   9   3
        -2  0   4   5
        1   3   6   -4
OUTPUT:
    ORIGINAL MATRIX
        8   7   9   3
        -2  0   4   5
        1   3   6   -4
LARGEST NUMBER: 9
    ROW = 0
    COLUMN = 2
SMALLEST NUMBER: -4
    ROW = 2
    COLUMN = 3
REARRANGED MATRIX
        -4  -2  0   1
        3   3   4   5
        6   7   8   9

Example 2
INPUT:  M = 3
        N = 22
OUTPUT:
SIZE OUT OF RANGE

ISC 2012 Computer Science Practical, Question 1

A prime palindrome integer is a positive integer (without leading zeros) which 
is prime as well as a palindrome. 

Given two positive integers m and n, where m < n, write a program to 
determine how many prime-palindrome integers are there in the 
range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them. 

The input contains two positive integers m and n where m < 3000 and n < 3000. 
Display the number of prime-palindrome integers in the specified range along 
with their values in the format specified below: 

Test your program with the sample data and some random data: 
Example 1 
INPUT:  m = 100 
        n = 1000 
OUTPUT: THE PRIME PALINDROME INTEGERS ARE: 
        101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929 
        FREQUENCY OF PRIME PALINDROME INTEGERS : 15 

Example 2 
INPUT:  m = 100 
        n = 5000 
OUTPUT: OUT OF RANGE
